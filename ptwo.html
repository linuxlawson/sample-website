<b>GitHub Pages</b>
<p>Short guide on using GitHub Pages</p>

<p>If you plan on uploading a version of this site (or any other) to GitHub Pages,<br>
below are the steps you would use to do so.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> GitHub Pages mostly only supports static websites at the moment,<br>
as opposed to more dynamic interactive sites. Read up a little if you think you should.</p>
<br>

<b>Step 1</b>
<p>Create a new repository (must be public to use GitHub Pages) give it a name and include a README.md file. A README is optional but I would suggest doing this as it gives you a place within your repo which you can use for a Title and Description of your repo.</p>
<br>  

<b>Step 2</b>
<p>Upload all needed files into your newly created repository. If using the Web UI, do this by clicking the 'add files' button, choose 'upload files'.
You can also use the drag and drop feature. Each time you upload a file, scroll down and click 'commit changes'.<br>
Title and Description for each commit is optional.</p>
<br>

<b>Step 3</b>
<p>From inside your repository, open settings (top of page), in left column click on Pages.<br>
Here you will see 'Build and Deployment'.<br>
For Source: <b>Deploy from branch</b>. For Branch: <b>main</b> or <b>master</b>.<br>
For Custom domains it's a bit different and you will have to read up on it.</p>
<br>

<b>Step 4</b>
<p>When finished, there will be a link to your Website on your profile page (right column).<br>
Click on 'Environments', and then 'View Deployment' to see your published website.<br>
If all went well, there it will be. There should also be a link in the Pages section too.</p>
<br>

<b>Step 5 (optional)</b>
<p>In your website repository, check your README file, edit (to your liking) if necessary. Also, click on the settings cogwheel to the right of 'About' in the right column. There you can include a short description, and add some topics (keywords). </p><br>

<b>Note:</b>


<p>It's very possible I left out some details in there somewhere.<br>
Anyway, this is just a sample website, not really meant to be an official instructable.</p><br>

<b>Updates & Other Notes<br>
(in descending order)</b>
<br><br>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 5 - Mar 25th, 2023</b><br>
Small changes here and there. Fixed some typos and other little things.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 4 - Nov 11, 2022</b><br>
Uploading files to GitHub.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 3 - Oct 31, 2022</b><br>
GitHub Pages? Yes you can absolutely use this for GitHub Pages. Short guide on how to do that on page 2.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 2 - Oct 30, 2022</b><br>
At first, this was a 2 column layout, but because I had a lot of space on the right side (almost equal to left) I added a 3rd column here, which turned out for the better since I am actually using it now.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 1 - Oct 29, 2022</b><br>
Eventually I will put any updates and other notes here, in descending order (most recent at top).</p>

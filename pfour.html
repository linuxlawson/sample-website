<b>Absolute and Relative Links</b>
<br><br>

<p>The difference between <i>absolute</i> and <i>relative</i> links.<br><br>

<p><b>Absolute Links</b></p>
<p>An <i>absolute</i> link uses a path that leads to a source outside of your own directory.<br><br>

For instance: You want to create a link to an image on someone elses website.<br><br>
You would use something like:<br> &lt;img src="https://www.somewebsite.com/images/picture.jpg"&gt;<br><br>

This will work for some time, but problems can occur if or when that particular website no longer exists, or if the owner changes or moves that particular image.<br>
Then you end up with a broken link (a link that points nowhere).<br><br>

Example of absolute link: <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Black-Dogs-HP-long.jpg">&nbsp;puppy</a><br>
With the link above, I have no control on how long it will remain working, since the link points to an image on a website that doesn't belong to me.<br><br><br>

</p>

<br>

<p><b>Relative Links</b></p>

<p>A <i>relative</i> link uses a path that leads to a source within your own directory.<br>
The examples below assume there is an image named 'dog.jpg' in the root directory.<br><br>

In the link below, dog.jpg is in the same directory.<br>
&lt;img src="dog.jpg"&gt;<br><br><br>

Below, dog.jpg is in the same directory (same result as above).<br>
&lt;img src="./dog.jpg"&gt;<br><br><br>


Below, dog.jpg is in the <i>images</i> folder of the same directory.<br>
&lt;img src="images/dog.jpg"&gt;<br><br><br>

Below, dog.jpg is in the <i>images</i> folder, which is in the <i>files</i> folder.<br>
&lt;img src="files/images/dog.jpg"&gt;<br><br><br>

Below, dog.jpg is in a folder one level up from current directory.<br>
&lt;img src="../dog.jpg"&gt;<br><br><br>

Below, dog.jpg is in a folder two levels up from current directory.<br>
&lt;img src="../../dog.jpg"&gt;

<b>Updates & Other Notes<br>
(in descending order)</b>
<br><br>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 5 - Mar 25th, 2023</b><br>
Small changes here and there. Fixed some typos and other little things.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 4 - Nov 11, 2022</b><br>
Uploading files to GitHub.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 3 - Oct 31, 2022</b><br>
GitHub Pages? Yes you can absolutely use this for GitHub Pages. Short guide on how to do that on page 2.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 2 - Oct 30, 2022</b><br>
At first, this was a 2 column layout, but because I had a lot of space on the right side (almost equal to left) I added a 3rd column here, which turned out for the better since I am actually using it now.</p>

<p class="rc"><b>Update 1 - Oct 29, 2022</b><br>
Eventually I will put any updates and other notes here, in descending order (most recent at top).</p>
